COMP 1006 | Assignment Two | Francesco Coniglione

The website is that of a fictional vacation company called Sunbridge Vacations. The site allows administrators to 
register and login, and then access the control panel where they can edit/delete pages and other administrators. For 
security purposes, password viewing and password modifications are not allowed. If an administrator forgets their 
password, they must delete and recreate their account. As a bonus, I've added two distinct headers (one for the admins 
and one for the public site) and a hidden 'Admin Access' tool for admins in the footer to return to the control panel. Also,
the login/register is changed to logout for those administrators who are logged in. This additional feature lets the user 
switch back and forth between the control panel and public site at ease.
